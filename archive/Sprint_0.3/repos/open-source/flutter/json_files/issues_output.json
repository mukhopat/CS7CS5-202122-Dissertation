I understand that there is a lot to say about text directionality when it comes to mixed characters from different languages. But the text I have above does not have mixed characters. Intuitive behavior is for the text to remain the same. I came across this when I had inconsistent `DateFormat`\r\n\r\nThank you all",

        "body": "Since the users of my app with an iPhone 13 Pro started complaining that the app doesn't feel like 120Hz, I started to realize that my app was getting capped at 60Hz and never gets past it.  I tested whether the app was running on 120Hz after setting the `CADisableMinimumFrameDurationOnPhone` to true on `Info.plist`. But the app didn't run on the highest refresh rate available. So I manually configured my `AppDelegate.swift` like below such that the app always runs at 120Hz.\r\n\r\nBut this had led to immense battery drain on the devices as iPhones variably control the refresh rates based on the display activity. How can I configure the AppDelegate to adapt to variable system refresh rates?\r\n\r\nAfter some web searches, I found this from Apple's developer documentation,\r\n`displayLink!.preferredFrameRateRange = CAFrameRateRange.default`\r\n\r\nWill setting this make my app forced to run at 60Hz again or would adapt to system refresh rates?\r\n\r\n(I'm not an iOS developer so any help would be much appreciated)\r\n\r\n``` import UIKit\r\nimport Flutter\r\n\r\n@UIApplicationMain\r\n@objc class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {\r\n  var displayLink :  CADisplayLink?\r\n  override func application(\r\n    _ application: UIApplication,\r\n    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?\r\n  ) -> Bool {\r\n      displayLink = CADisplayLink(target: self, selector: #selector(displayLinkCallback))\r\n      displayLink!.add(to: .current, forMode: .default)\r\n      if #available(iOS 15.0, *) {\r\n          displayLink!.preferredFrameRateRange = CAFrameRateRange(minimum:120, maximum:120, preferred:120)\r\n      }\r\n    GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: self)\r\n    return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @objc func displayLinkCallback(){\r\n\r\n  }\r\n} \r\n\r\n",

        "body": "## Use case\r\n\r\nThe current implementation for the video player plugin has some problems with live streams (videos with \"infinite\"/unknown/unset duration).\r\n\r\n### Cross-platform TIME_UNSET \r\n\r\nTIME_UNSET is the value used as the \"length\" of a live video. Its current value [comes from ExoPlayer2](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/blob/28eff0a8c167d146d73d62aa21a7d93d95bc2578/packages/video_player/video_player_android/android/src/main/java/io/flutter/plugins/videoplayer/VideoPlayer.java#L291) directly ([C.TIME_UNSET](https://exoplayer.dev/doc/reference/constant-values.html#com.google.android.exoplayer2.C.TIME_UNSET)). They had [good reasons to pick that value](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/commit/1579b68cf63c0c3c2be310ce3c9e8caf933c7a99).\r\n\r\nThe [same value was reused](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/blob/a9d2381908cf7adf899d0fcec727f9968fbac01e/packages/video_player/video_player_avfoundation/ios/Classes/FLTVideoPlayerPlugin.m#L114-L119) when improving the live video features in the iOS implementation, so both platforms would behave the same.\r\n\r\nWhen the Web platform attempted to reuse that same magic value; it was too \"wide\" to be represented exactly by JavaScript, so we needed to use [another one](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/pull/6101#issuecomment-1188499016).\r\n\r\n* [ ] **Ensure that all the mobile implementations start returning what the web is returning:** `-(2^53) + 2`, or `-9007199254740990`. Note: **this is a breaking change!**\r\n\r\n### Provided UI Widgets\r\n\r\n`package:video_player` provides a bunch of Widgets that render different parts of the UI of a Video player, like the `_VideoScrubber`, the `VideoProgressIndicator` (and maybe others).\r\n\r\nCurrently, they all seem to behave as if the `duration` of the video was always finite, and positive. \r\n\r\n* [ ] **Update UI Widgets to support `TIME_UNSET` durations.**\r\n\r\n### Player logic\r\n\r\nMost of the player logic assumes that the video has a finite duration, and uses the `duration` coming from the video controller to do things like:\r\n\r\n* handle the `VideoEventType.completed` event to seek \"to the end\"\r\n* validate if a video can be `seekTo`'d to a given position (only if `0 < position < duration`)\r\n\r\nFinally, \r\n\r\n* [ ] **Check that the player logic handles well `TIME_UNSET` durations.**",
