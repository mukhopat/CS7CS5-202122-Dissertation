Previously we were inconsistent about whether they should be public or not. Making them all private seemed more likely to break users than making them all public.\r\n\r\n* Added documentation to newly public classes.\r\n\r\n* Added a link to the relevant global variable instance of the class to each TextSelectionControls subclass.\r\n\r\n* Moved the debugCheckHasMaterialLocalizations assert in the _DesktopTextSelectionControlsToolbarState builder to before the first early-out, to improve the consistency of the assert firing.\r\n\r\n* Documented the localizations needs of SelectionArea in the class documentation.\r\n\r\n* Added a call to debugCheckHasMaterialLocalizations to SelectionArea to make the needs more obvious (previously the assert only fired once the toolbar was rendered, which may not happen during brief testing).\r\n\r\n* Added some comments to various selectionColor properties to mention that the value has no effect when selection is impossible.\r\n\r\n* Elaborated the documentation regarding pageRouteBuilder in the WidgetsApp constructor and the pageRouteBuilder property.\r\n\r\n* Added a DefaultSelectionStyle.defaultColor constant, which is used in the Text widget now in case it can't find a selection color. Added a test for this.\r\n\r\n* Fixed the text of the assert in DefaultSelectionStyle's _NullWidget (copy pasta).\r\n\r\n* Fixed minor typo in EditableText docs.\r\n\r\n* Added to Overlay's docs to mention that it needs a Directionality.\r\n\r\n* Added more documentation and breadcrumbs to Route subclasses.\r\n\r\n* Added more introductory documentation to SelectableRegion and some breadcrumbs to SelectionContainer.\r\n\r\n* Exported TextSelectionPoint from widgets/text_selection, since it's in its API.\r\n\r\n* Renamed `position` argument to `selectionMidpoint` in `TextSelectionControls.buildToolbar` to match implementations.\r\n\r\n* Fixed typo in TODO.\r\n\r\n* Created a new EmptyTextSelectionControls class (and corresponding emptyTextSelectionControls global variable) that can be used when no text selection UI is needed (e.g. in experiments or samples). Added references to it in various places.\r\n\r\n* Fixed an omitted export in flutter_test.\r\n\r\n* Fixed a bunch of places where we used \"ensureInitialized\" instead of \"instance\".\r\n\r\n* Fixed copypasta in bufferMatchesGoldenFile docs.",

This Material widget is added only when the `ExpansionTile` is expanded.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nWhen an `ExpansionTile` has a `ListTile` in its children list, the `ListTile` background leaks on the `ExpansionTile` title widget during the expansion animation.\r\n\r\nDemo (here \u201cTest2\u201d is the `ExpansionTile` title, \u2018Foo\u2019 is a `ListTile` with a green background color, see #107030 for more information) :\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/840911/177329283-71a828b3-6fe8-4b0d-9e93-fb03f613ebd1.mp4\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\n- #102310 was a generic PR trying to add a `Material` widget in all `ListTile`. It was rejected due to performance concerns.\r\n- #107104 replaced 102310 by adding some useful comments on ListTile.\r\n- This PR uses the fix proposed by #107104, and applied it to the ExpansionTile widget.\r\n\r\n**Pros**: users putting a ListTile in an ExpansionTile won\u2019t have the background color leak.\r\n**Cons**: a Material Widget is added on any expanded ExpansionTile, whatever the ExpansionTile content is.\r\n\r\nOne goal of this PR is to get an answer to the following question  \u201cdo we add some Material widget on some high level widget (such as ExpansionTile) or do we guide the user to find this solution?\u201d. In this particular case, it is not obvious for a user to understand that the problem is not related to the ExpansionTile so she/he might have some hard time to find the fix proposed on `ListTile` documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related Issue\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/107030\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nAdds 1 test.",

It will be interesting to see if it breaks some Google client tests and/or some Google internal tests.\r\n\r\nFrom `TabBarView` history, the check was part of a [large refactoring](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/7387) in early 2017, so maybe it was required at this time. Or maybe it is required for some use cases that are not covered by existing tests, if so I will update this PR to add such tests.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, `TabBarView` children are not updated during a transition.\r\n(The '+1' button updates the state with a slight delay. If the user selects a new tab before the end of this delay, the updated state is not reflected in the tab bar bodies, for more information see https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/107399):\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/840911/178998031-47ffa8aa-87c8-4118-81b4-06d9cbbf55ac.mp4\r\n\r\nAfter, `TabBarView` children can be updated during a transition :\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/840911/179000242-c55b13dc-8c90-40d6-9756-260a6c4efa07.mp4\r\n\r\n## Related Issue\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/107399\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nAdds 1 test.",
